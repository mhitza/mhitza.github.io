As the Deck is mainly marketed as a portable gaming device, there are a few kinks with
the desktop experience. In this living blog post I'm collecting the notes, scripts, and steps
I've went through to replicate my existing workflows on the Deck Desktop.

SteamOS is the first immutable distro I'm using, which makes things a bit more challenging,
after using Fedora - non-GNOME spins - for more than 14 years where I've become accustomed to the
distribution packages, and patched up the system to what I wanted by `sudo vim`ing across the
filesystem.
