*I got something that works well enough for an automation that I'm going to use just locally.*

I really did expect to spend 1-2 hours off course, yet by the time I was done with the bash script 
4 hours have passed. I didn't keep track of the time it took to rewrite all my notes into
something I could publish, or the extra time it took to act on plan B and the ChatGPT solution exploration.

I have PyCharm installed locally for some OSS software. Maybe If I would
have started with it I could have benefited on my first attempt with intellisense for the Ansible library,
or help me slice through the file module faster.
It could have helped me debug the
execution issues I've had with the action plugin approach. However, never having used a step debugger with
Python, I wasn't inclined to detour once again.


In the end it was an interesting time diving into the topic, better than other debugging sessions I've had in
the past. It was also the first time I actively set out to take notes with the intent on publishing an article
at the end of the development/debugging session. I think I might (no promise) make a habit out of this going
forward, even if most of the time I probably won't be publishing my results/notes.

Regarding my Kagi search review, my post got larger than I'd like, and the review itself seems to continue to expand as
well. Will leave it out for another time.
