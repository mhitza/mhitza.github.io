title: LVM snapshots

summary: A great feature to use when experimenting with different system setups. I no longer have to worry about polluting my system with extra packages when I want to test a new desktop environment, or a new driver version, or even a botched system installation. With LVM I can snapshot a working system and restore it if something goes wrong.
