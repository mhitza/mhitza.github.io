title: vim + GNU Guile development environment

summary: After spending hours collecting various bits and pieces, I finally have a setup that feel very close to an integrated development environment for Guile programming. While Guile fell on the sideline since I originally shared this setup, with minor tweaks, it continues to work nicely with other Schemes.
