title: Using Vimwiki like a standard desktop application
url: https://gist.github.com/74bedf5de1b3ace84d02bb634128193e
summary: When taking notes I prefer to launch a note-taking application, write a line, or two, then close the application. Having used Vimwiki for a couple of days, I had to create a desktop entry wrapper around it, just to avoid the "Open Terminal first", step.
